<caption>Shero â€“ mild chickpea flour, onions, fresh tomato, red pepper, olive oil, green pepper, garlic</caption>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul></ul>
<li>2 medium onions , diced</li>
<li>1 tomato , pureed (or 4 oz tomato puree)</li>
<li>1/2 cup oil</li>
<li>1/2 cup Shiro powder (dried chickpea powder)</li>
<li>1-1/2 to 2 cups water</li>
<li>1 tbsp Berbere (Ethiopian spice mix)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<p>Start by pureeing the onions in a blender. Dump the onion mush into a hot dry skillet.</p>
<p>Stir frequently until the water evaporates and the onions start to get just a tiny bit of light brown color.</p>
<p>Once the onions begin to color a bit, add 1/2 cup of oil and berbere. (If you like more of a kick, add 2-3 times more than the suggested amount.)</p>
<p>Let onion, oil, and berbere infuse for a minute or two then add pureed tomato.</p>

<p>Before you add the shiro powder, make sure that you have the water close by.
<br>Add your shiro powder gradually, briskly stirring.
    It will get thick very quickly. Once the shiro seems pretty well mixed into the oil, add 1-1/2 to 2 cups of water. Stir well.</p>

<p>Simmer until shiro spread is at desired consistency.
    Can be served with injera, pita bread, rice, roti, or Ethiopian honey bread.</p>
<p><strong>Serves two.</strong></p>
