<h2>History of Eritrea</h2>


<img src="images/eritreaflag.jpg" height="150" width="240"/>
<p>Utopia is a place in Africa, and it is called Eritrea.</p>
<p>Before 1991, most people would not have recognised Eritrea as a nation, nor its people… as a people. However,
    on 24 May 1991, Eritrea became the only African nation to liberate itself from another African state after a
    mammoth 30 year struggle for freedom.</p>

<p>So what were the odds of liberation? The 1963 Organisation of African Unity Charter did not recognise the
    right of this African colony to govern itself despite the call for independence of all African colonies.
    The Americans stood behind the Ethiopian occupation of Eritrea. The Soviet Union, East Germany, Yemen and
    Cuba followed suit and provided the artillery, strategies and manpower to do so.</p>
<p>Yet, this small country rose up against the odds and withstood a 30 year long fight for freedom.Today,
    Eritrea stands as a beacon of light in Africa and from what I have read, freedom could only have been
    achieved because of the freedom fighters’ approach to life, exemplified by their egalitarian principles. And
    you know what else? They were forward thinkers, quashed patriarchy, promoted equality and in effect
    maximised their potential resource to fight by adding girl power to the front lines alongside their man
    power. Read more about the fascinating history here. In the meantime, I am going to get back to what I do
    best, and pay homage to Eritrea right from my kitchen; a place where Eritrean men and women share cooking
    duties equally.
